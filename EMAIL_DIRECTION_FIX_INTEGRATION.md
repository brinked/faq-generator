# Email Direction Fix Integration

## Summary
Integrated the email direction fix script (`scripts/fix-email-direction.js`) into the main application so it runs automatically after email sync operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `fixEmailDirectionAndResponses()` method to EmailService
- Location: `src/services/emailService.js`
- This method contains all the logic from the fix script:
  - Identifies email direction (inbound/outbound) based on sender
  - Analyzes email threads to find which customer emails have responses
  - Updates filtering status to mark qualified emails for FAQ generation
  - Returns statistics about the fix operation

### 2. Integrated fix into sync workflow
- Modified `syncAllAccounts()` in `src/services/emailService.js`
- After syncing emails, the fix automatically runs if any emails were synced
- Fix statistics are included in the sync results

### 3. Removed redundant thread analysis
- Removed the old `analyzeThreadsForResponses()` call from `saveEmails()`
- This functionality is now handled comprehensively in the new method

### 4. Added API endpoint for manual triggering
- Added POST `/api/sync/fix-direction` endpoint in `src/routes/sync.js`
- Allows manual triggering of the email direction fix if needed
- Returns statistics about the fix operation

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Operation**: When emails are synced via `/api/sync/trigger`, the direction fix runs automatically after all accounts are synced.

2. **Manual Operation**: You can manually trigger the fix by calling:
   ```
   POST /api/sync/fix-direction
   ```

3. **What the fix does**:
   - Resets all emails to 'inbound' direction
   - Identifies emails from connected business accounts and marks them as 'outbound'
   - Analyzes email threads to find customer emails that received responses
   - Updates filtering status:
     - Outbound emails → filtered_out (business emails)
     - Inbound without response → filtered_out (no business response)
     - Inbound with response → qualified (ready for FAQ generation)

## Benefits

1. **No Manual Intervention**: The fix runs automatically during normal sync operations
2. **Consistent Data**: Ensures all emails are properly categorized for FAQ processing
3. **Better FAQ Quality**: Only processes customer emails that received business responses
4. **API Access**: Can still trigger the fix manually if needed for debugging

## Deployment

After pushing these changes to git, Render will automatically redeploy the application with the integrated fix.
