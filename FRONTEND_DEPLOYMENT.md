# Frontend Deployment Guide

## Current Status

The frontend has been built locally but needs to be deployed to Render.com to be visible at https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com.

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add React frontend interface"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger Render Deployment**
   - Go to your Render.com dashboard
   - Find your `faq-generator-web` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (~5-10 minutes)

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Visit: https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com
   - You should see the React frontend instead of the API JSON

### Option 2: Local Build + Push

If you want to build locally first:

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Verify build exists
ls -la client/build/

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add built React frontend"
git push origin main
```

## What Happens During Deployment

1. **Render Build Process**:
   ```bash
   npm install          # Install backend dependencies
   npm run build        # Build frontend (runs: cd client && npm install && npm run build)
   ```

2. **Server Configuration**:
   - In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), the server serves static files from `client/build/`
   - All non-API routes (`/*`) serve the React app
   - API routes (`/api/*`) continue to work normally

3. **Frontend Features Available**:
   - Step-by-step email connection wizard
   - Real-time processing status with progress bars
   - FAQ display with search, filter, and editing
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see the API JSON:

1. **Check Build Directory**:
   ```bash
   # Should exist and contain files
   ls -la client/build/
   ```

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set in Render
   - Verify all other environment variables are configured

3. **Check Render Logs**:
   - Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Logs
   - Look for build errors or missing files

4. **Manual Build Test**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**: Check that all dependencies are in `client/package.json`
2. **Static Files Not Served**: Verify `client/build` directory exists
3. **API Calls Fail**: Check CORS and API URL configuration

## Environment Variables for Frontend

Make sure these are set in Render:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com
```

## Expected Result

After successful deployment, visiting https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com should show:

- ✅ FAQ Generator header with logo
- ✅ Step indicator showing "Connect Email" as step 1
- ✅ Gmail and Outlook connection cards
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive design
- ✅ No more API JSON response

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test Email Connection**: Try connecting a Gmail or Outlook account
2. **Test Processing**: Verify real-time progress updates work
3. **Test FAQ Display**: Check that FAQs are displayed properly
4. **Mobile Testing**: Verify responsive design on mobile devices
