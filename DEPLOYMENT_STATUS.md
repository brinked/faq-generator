# Deployment Status - FAQ Generator Fixes

## âœ… Code Changes Pushed
**Latest Commit**: `edfc4bf` - Fix migration script to handle DO blocks properly

### Changes Deployed:
1. **OpenAI API Compatibility Fix** - `aiService.js` updated for v3 syntax
2. **Migration Script Fix** - `migrate.js` now handles `DO $$ ... END $$;` blocks
3. **Diagnostic Tools** - Added diagnostic script and status tracking

## ðŸ”„ Waiting for Render Deployment
- Code pushed to GitHub at 19:15 UTC
- Render should automatically detect and deploy changes
- Watch for server restart in logs

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (After Render Deploys):

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
npm run migrate
```
**Expected**: Should complete without "unterminated dollar-quoted string" error

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-current-issues.js
```
**Expected**: Should show all systems operational

### Step 3: Monitor FAQ Processing
- Watch for successful email processing beyond 85 emails
- No more OpenAI API errors
- No more database function errors
- Stable server operation

## ðŸš¨ If Migration Still Fails
If you still get parsing errors, we may need to manually create the database function. The diagnostic script will help identify any remaining issues.
