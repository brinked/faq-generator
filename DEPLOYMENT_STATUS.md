## Deployment Architecture

```
User Request → Render.com → Express Server → React App (if non-API route)
                                         → API Response (if /api/* route)
```

## Environment Variables Required

The following are already configured in Render:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com`
- `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com`
- All OAuth and API credentials

## Timeline

- **Build Process**: ~5-10 minutes (currently running)
- **Git Operations**: ~1 minute
- **Render Deployment**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Total Time**: ~15-20 minutes

## Success Indicators
