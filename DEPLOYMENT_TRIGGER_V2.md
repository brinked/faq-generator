# DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER V2 - Critical Fix for Const Assignment Error

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-21 23:48:00 UTC  
**Priority:** URGENT  
**Previous Deployment:** 2025-07-21 22:43:00 UTC (FAILED TO PROPAGATE)

## Critical Issue
FAQ generator is failing with "Assignment to constant variable" error at aiService.js:143

## Error Details
```
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    at AIService.detectQuestions (/opt/render/project/src/src/services/aiService.js:143:15)
```

## Fix Applied
Changed line 130 in `src/services/aiService.js` from:
```javascript
const content = response.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();
```
To:
```javascript
let content = response.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. **Commit this file** to trigger Render deployment
2. **Monitor deployment** in Render dashboard
3. **Clear build cache** if deployment doesn't pick up changes
4. **Run diagnostic** after deployment: `node scripts/check-deployed-code.js`

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Deployment completed in Render dashboard
- [ ] No build errors in deployment logs
- [ ] Diagnostic script confirms "let content" at line 130
- [ ] Email processing API returns 200 status
- [ ] No "Assignment to constant variable" errors in logs

## All Fixes Included
1. ✅ OpenAI v3 compatibility (constructor error fixed)
2. ✅ Const assignment error (detectQuestions method fixed)
3. ✅ Missing database function (update_faq_group_stats added)
4. ✅ Memory optimization (2GB Render limit handled)
5. ✅ Health monitoring system (enhanced monitoring)
6. ✅ Error handling improvements

## Expected Result
FAQ generator should process emails beyond the 60 email limit without errors.

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Check Render build logs for transformation issues
2. SSH into Render instance to verify deployed code
3. Consider manual deployment with cache clear
