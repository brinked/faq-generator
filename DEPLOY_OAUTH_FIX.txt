DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER: OAuth Token Refresh Fix + Server Startup Improvements

Timestamp: 2025-07-22T02:12:00Z

CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. OAuth Token Refresh Fix:
   - Fixed invalid_grant errors in Gmail sync
   - Automatic token refresh when tokens expire
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Accounts will automatically become active again

2. Server Startup Improvements:
   - Added connection timeouts and retries
   - Enhanced error handling during initialization
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical services
   - Better logging for debugging deployment issues

3. Files Modified:
   - src/services/emailService.js (OAuth token refresh logic)
   - src/services/gmailService.js (enhanced error handling)
   - server.js (robust initialization)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- No more 502 errors on deployment
- Gmail sync will work without invalid_grant errors
- Automatic token refresh for expired accounts
- More reliable server startup process

This deployment should resolve both the OAuth token refresh issue and the 502 deployment errors.
