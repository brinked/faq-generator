# HOTFIX: 502 Error Resolution

## üö® Critical Issue
The application was returning 502 errors because it was trying to use database columns that don't exist in production:
- `processed_for_faq`
- `processed_at`
- `processing_error`

## üõ†Ô∏è Hotfix Applied

### 1. Added Graceful Fallbacks
Modified the following files to handle missing columns gracefully:
- `emailService.js` - Added column existence check before queries
- `memoryOptimizedProcessor.js` - Added try-catch blocks around UPDATE statements

### 2. Created Migration API Endpoint
Added `/api/migration` endpoints to run database migrations without SSH access:
- `GET /api/migration/status` - Check if migration is needed
- `POST /api/migration/run` - Run the migration (requires X-Migration-Key header)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Hotfix
The hotfix will allow the app to start without the missing columns.

### Step 2: Run Migration via API
Once deployed, run:
```bash
curl -X POST https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com/api/migration/run \
  -H "X-Migration-Key: default-migration-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration
```bash
curl https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com/api/migration/status
```

## üìã Files Modified
1. `src/services/emailService.js` - Added column check in getEmailsForProcessing
2. `src/services/memoryOptimizedProcessor.js` - Added error handling for missing columns
3. `src/routes/migration.js` - New migration API endpoint
4. `server.js` - Registered migration route

## ‚úÖ Expected Result
1. App will start without 502 errors
2. Email processing will work with fallback queries
3. Migration can be run via API to add missing columns
4. Once migrated, full functionality will be restored

## üîí Security Note
In production, set the `MIGRATION_KEY` environment variable to secure the migration endpoint.
