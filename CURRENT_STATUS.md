# Current Status Update - FAQ Generator Issues

## ✅ Completed Fixes
- **OpenAI API Compatibility**: Fixed v3/v4 syntax mismatch in `aiService.js`
- **Code Deployed**: Changes pushed to GitHub and deployed to Render
- **Server Restarted**: Application is running with new code

## ⚠️ Still Experiencing Issues
Based on latest logs:
- Generic "Error processing email" messages (without specific error details)
- Server restarts occurring
- Processing appears to be failing on individual emails

## 🔍 Most Likely Remaining Issue
**Database Migration Not Run**: The `update_faq_group_stats` function likely still doesn't exist in production database.

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic Script
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-current-issues.js
```

### Step 3: Check Results
The diagnostic script will tell you:
- ✅ or ❌ Database function exists
- ✅ or ❌ OpenAI API configured
- ✅ or ❌ OpenAI client working
- Email processing statistics

## 📋 Expected Outcome
After running the migration:
- Database function errors should stop
- Email processing should resume normally
- FAQ generation should complete without freezing
- Server should remain stable

## 🔧 If Issues Persist
If problems continue after migration, the diagnostic script will help identify:
- OpenAI API key issues
- Database connection problems
- Other configuration issues

**Next Update**: Run the migration and diagnostic, then report results
