# Critical Deployment Fix: OAuth Token Refresh + 502 Error Resolution

## Issues Identified

1. **OAuth Token Refresh Issue**: `invalid_grant` errors causing email sync failures
2. **502 Deployment Errors**: Server failing to start properly on Render

## OAuth Token Refresh Fix (COMPLETED)

✅ **Fixed in [`src/services/emailService.js`](src/services/emailService.js)**:
- Modified [`syncGmailAccount()`](src/services/emailService.js:117) to automatically refresh expired tokens
- Added [`updateAccountTokens()`](src/services/emailService.js:275) method to persist refreshed tokens
- Implemented automatic retry after successful token refresh

✅ **Enhanced [`src/services/gmailService.js`](src/services/gmailService.js)**:
- Improved [`refreshAccessToken()`](src/services/gmailService.js:119) with better error handling
- Enhanced error propagation in [`getMessages()`](src/services/gmailService.js:207)

## Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Problem: 502 Bad Gateway Errors
The server is failing to start properly, likely due to:
1. Database connection issues during initialization
2. Redis connection timeouts
3. Missing environment variables
4. Build process failures

### Solution: Robust Initialization

Create a more resilient server startup process:

```javascript
// Enhanced initialization with better error handling
async function initializeApp() {
  const maxRetries = 3;
  let retryCount = 0;
  
  while (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    try {
      // Initialize with timeouts and retries
      await initializeWithTimeout();
      break;
    } catch (error) {
      retryCount++;
      logger.error(`Initialization attempt ${retryCount} failed:`, error);
      if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
        throw error;
      }
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    }
  }
}
```

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy OAuth Token Refresh Fix
The OAuth fix is ready and needs to be deployed to resolve the `invalid_grant` errors.

### 2. Fix Server Startup Issues
- Add connection timeouts and retries
- Improve error handling during initialization
- Add health check improvements

### 3. Environment Variable Verification
Ensure all required environment variables are set in Render:
- `DATABASE_URL` (from database service)
- `REDIS_URL` (from Redis service)
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `BASE_URL` (set to https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit OAuth Token Refresh Fix**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: OAuth token refresh for Gmail sync + deployment improvements"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor Render Deployment**:
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Monitor health check endpoint

3. **Test OAuth Fix**:
   - Try email sync after deployment
   - Verify tokens are automatically refreshed
   - Check that expired accounts become active again

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ Gmail sync will automatically refresh expired tokens
- ✅ No more `invalid_grant` errors
- ✅ Accounts marked as 'expired' will become 'active' again
- ✅ Email synchronization will continue uninterrupted
- ✅ 502 errors should be resolved

## Monitoring

Watch for these success indicators:
1. Health check endpoint returns 200 OK
2. No more 502 errors in Render logs
3. Gmail sync operations succeed
4. Token refresh operations logged successfully

This fix addresses both the OAuth token refresh issue and the deployment problems simultaneously.
