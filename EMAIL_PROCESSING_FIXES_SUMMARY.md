# Email Processing Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Email Direction Fix Integration**
   - Integrated `fix-email-direction.js` script into the main application
   - Automatically runs after email sync to categorize emails correctly
   - Identifies inbound (customer) vs outbound (business) emails
   - Marks emails with business responses as qualified for FAQ generation

2. **FAQ Processing Filter Fix**
   - Fixed critical issue where questions were being extracted from business emails
   - Updated `getEmailsForProcessing()` to only select:
     - `direction = 'inbound'` (customer emails only)
     - `filtering_status = 'qualified'` (emails that received business responses)
   - Prevents processing of business emails sent to customers
   - Ensures thread context doesn't pollute FAQ generation

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Direction Fix (`fixEmailDirectionAndResponses()`)
- Resets all emails to 'inbound' initially
- Identifies emails from connected business accounts as 'outbound'
- Analyzes email threads to find customer emails with responses
- Updates filtering status:
  - Outbound → filtered_out (business emails)
  - Inbound without response → filtered_out
  - Inbound with response → qualified

### 2. Email Processing Query Updates
```sql
-- Only process emails that are:
WHERE e.processed_for_faq = false
  AND e.body_text IS NOT NULL
  AND LENGTH(e.body_text) > 50
  AND e.direction = 'inbound'        -- Customer emails only
  AND e.filtering_status = 'qualified' -- Has business response
```

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/sync/fix-direction** - Manually run email direction fix
- **POST /api/sync/trigger** - Sync emails (automatically runs direction fix)

## Results

After applying these fixes:
- Only customer emails are processed for FAQ generation
- Only emails that received business responses are considered
- Business emails to customers are excluded from processing
- Email thread context doesn't contaminate FAQ extraction

## Deployment

All changes have been deployed to production via Render.
