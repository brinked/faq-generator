- **Gradient backgrounds** for active/completed states
- **Pulse animation** for active step
- **Improved connector lines** with gradient fills
- **Glass morphism progress bar** with enhanced styling
- **Better responsive layout** with proper spacing

#### Main Application

### Modern Aesthetics
- **Gradient backgrounds** and buttons
- **Rounded corners** and soft shadows

## üì± Responsive Breakpoints

```css

### Neutral Colors
- **Gray Scale**: From `#f9fafb` to `#111827`
- **Glass Effects**: White with 60-80% transparency

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build with Tailwind verification
npm run build:tailwind
```

### Deployment
1. Run `npm run build:tailwind` to ensure proper Tailwind compilation
2. Deploy the `build` folder to your hosting service (Render.com)
3. Verify all styles are working correctly in production

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Components
1. Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
2. Follow the glass morphism pattern for cards
3. Use consistent spacing and color schemes
4. Add proper animations and transitions

### Modifying Colors
Update `tailwind.config.js` to change the color palette:
```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: { /* your colors */ },
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```
