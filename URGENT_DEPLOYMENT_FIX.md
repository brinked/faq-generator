# URGENT: Fix Assignment to Constant Variable Error

## Issue Summary
The FAQ generator is failing with "Assignment to constant variable" error at line 143 in aiService.js. The local code has the fix (`let content` instead of `const content`), but the deployed version on Render still has the old code.

## Root Cause
The deployment from ~1 hour ago (22:43 UTC) appears to have failed or not fully propagated. The error logs from 23:45 UTC show the issue is still occurring.

## Immediate Fix Steps

### 1. Verify Local Fix
The local code already has the correct fix at line 130 of `src/services/aiService.js`:
```javascript
let content = response.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();
```

### 2. Force Render Redeployment

#### Option A: Update DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGER.txt
1. Update the DEPLOYMENT_TRIGGER.txt file with a new timestamp
2. Commit and push to trigger Render deployment

#### Option B: Manual Deployment via Render Dashboard
1. Log into Render dashboard
2. Navigate to the faq-generator-web service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Clear build cache & deploy"

### 3. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Verify all changes are committed locally
- [ ] Push to GitHub main branch
- [ ] Monitor Render deployment logs
- [ ] Run diagnostic script after deployment
- [ ] Test email processing

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployed Code
After deployment completes, SSH into Render or use the diagnostic script:
```bash
node scripts/check-deployed-code.js
```

Expected output:
- Line 130: `let content = response.data.choices[0].message.content.trim();`
- ✅ Fix is present: "let content" found

### 2. Test Email Processing
Trigger email processing via the API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com/api/sync/process-faqs
```

## Additional Fixes Already in Place
1. ✅ OpenAI v3 compatibility
2. ✅ Memory optimization for 2GB limit
3. ✅ Database function (update_faq_group_stats)
4. ✅ Enhanced error handling

## Emergency Rollback
If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check if there's a build transformation issue
2. Consider adding explicit error handling around line 143
3. Review Render build logs for any warnings

## Contact
If deployment issues persist, check:
- GitHub Actions (if configured)
- Render service logs
- Build command output in Render dashboard
