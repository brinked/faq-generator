# FAQ Generator Fix - Action Plan Summary

## üö® Critical Issue
**Error:** "Assignment to constant variable" at aiService.js:143  
**Impact:** FAQ generator stuck at processing 60 emails  
**Root Cause:** Deployed code has `const content` instead of `let content` at line 130

## ‚úÖ Fix Status
- **Local Code:** Already fixed (has `let content`)
- **Deployed Code:** Still has old version (needs deployment)
- **Last Deployment Attempt:** Failed to propagate (22:43 UTC)

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy the Fix (5 minutes)
```bash
# From faq-generator directory
git add .
git commit -m "URGENT FIX: Change const to let in aiService.js line 130"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Force Render Deployment
- Option A: Wait for automatic deployment from GitHub push
- Option B: Manual deploy with cache clear in Render dashboard

### 3. Verify Deployment (2 minutes)
```bash
# Run diagnostic script
node scripts/check-deployed-code.js
```

### 4. Test the Fix (2 minutes)
```bash
# Trigger email processing
curl -X POST https://faq-generator-web.onrender.com/api/sync/process-faqs
```

## üìã Success Checklist
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Render deployment started
- [ ] Build completed without errors
- [ ] Diagnostic confirms "let content" deployed
