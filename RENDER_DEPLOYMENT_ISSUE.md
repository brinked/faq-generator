# 🚨 RENDER DEPLOYMENT ISSUE DETECTED

**Issue:** Render is deploying commit `c4674cf` instead of latest `182c742`

## ✅ CRITICAL FIX IS IN GIT

**The main fix is in commit `c0b1964`:**
- Fixed confidence_score column name in memoryOptimizedProcessor.js
- Added embedding generation during question processing
- This prevents NULL confidence scores that broke FAQ generation

## 🔧 MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

### Option 1: Force Deploy Latest Commit
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select `faq-generator-web` service
3. Go to "Manual Deploy" 
4. **Select commit `182c742`** (or latest)
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Repeat for `faq-generator-worker`

### Option 2: Redeploy from Render Dashboard
1. Go to each service (web, worker, crons)
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Ensure it's using the latest commit

### Option 3: Check Auto-Deploy Settings
1. Verify auto-deploy is enabled for main branch
2. Check if there are any deployment failures
3. Look for build errors in deployment logs

## 📋 VERIFICATION

After successful deployment, the services should have:
- ✅ Fixed confidence_score column usage
- ✅ Embedding generation during question processing
- ✅ Proper handling of new email processing

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS

- ✅ **Data repaired**: 7 FAQs working from existing questions
- ✅ **Code fixed**: All fixes pushed to Git
- ❌ **Deployment**: Render not picking up latest commits

**The fixes are ready - just need Render to deploy the correct commit!**
